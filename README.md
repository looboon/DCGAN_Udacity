# Udacity Nanodegree Assignments

Repo for assignments 1-5 done for completion of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

They include:

1) Build a neural network in numpy.
2) Image Classification from CIFAR-10 dataset using CNNs in Tensorflow.
3) Generate Simpsons' TV scripts with RNNs in Tensorflow.
4) Language translation from English to French with seq2seq models with Tensorflow.
5) Trained a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) coded in Tensorflow using CelebA dataset to generate new faces from celebrity faces. Training done on Floydhub.

All codes were done in Tensorflow.
